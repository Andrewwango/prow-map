# Land access research: discovering lost rights of way using public data

The code in this repository performs analysis of public GPX data and UK rights of way. The graphic outputs of this code are used for my blog post [Land access research: discovering lost rights of way using public data](https://andrewwango.github.io/prow_ml/) and my earth.org article [Why Improving UK Land Access Rights Is Important For A More Sustainable Outdoors](https://earth.org/data_visualization/uk-land-access-rights/).
